# What is Easy Deployï¼Ÿ
[Easy Deploy](/EasyDeploy/) is a software hosting program that runs in Windows, making it easier to run multiple applications, console programs, command-line programs, or script programs.

In actual project applications, many applications do not need UI interface, so it is easy to use the console program for development. However, when the console program is actually deployed, there are many problems. For example, the icon uses the default style of the development language, or uses the default icon of the console, which makes it difficult to check what is missing after the program crashes abnormally, or it is easier to configure startup and self startup for unified management. Or like [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html)Deploy some service programs like. Of course, the program containing UI can also be deployed on it, but it seems that it can only be used as a quick launcher, or as a watchdog program to ensure that the program always runs and automatically restarts when it crashes.
