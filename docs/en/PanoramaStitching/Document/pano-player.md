# Panorama Player
Panorama video is input through multiple or single channels, decoded through Panorama stitching or using local decoding to achieve low latency stitching display. Based on the physical layout of the spliced screen and the actual resolution of each screen, the system performs high-precision area cropping on the panorama and completes multi window mapping.
